<p>This project investigated various data processing and model development options for analyzing the FSDnoisy18k dataset, which provides a large number of samples across twenty categories of sounds. A CNN model was developed, as well as a CNN and GRU hybrid model. Both models were duplicated, with one being trained on the clean data, and the other being trained on the full dataset. Comparing the results of the four models showed that the hybrid model trained on the full dataset had the highest performance, with an overall test accuracy of 66%. These results line up with the original FSDnoisy18k paper, and highlight the importance of sample size when training a model, as well as the benefits of incorporating temporal modeling through GRU layers.</p></p>

      <p><p>Hardware verification is a integral part of the chip design process. Failures to catch defects can cost millions of dollars for companies. Software bugs can often be patched with a quick update, but most hardware faults can only be fixed by recalling the chip and replacing it.</p>
<p>Because of this, Verification Engineers are often employed by companies for the sole purpose of debugging and catching errors in the design before final chip tape out.</p></p>

      <p><p>Creating an adder in Python takes about thirty seconds. As a matter of fact, in almost every programming language this simple addition operation a miniscule amount of time to program. Writing an adder in assembly code may take slightly longer, though it will still not be a problem. Creating an 8-bit adder as an IC design took me almost six weeks to accomplish.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, <em>physical integrated chip design</em> refers to strips of metal connecting to each other, sending electrical current one way or the other. Controlling the flow of electricity throughout these strips of metal can be a complicated process, and eventually ends up looking something like this.</p></p>
